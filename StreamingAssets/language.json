        "levelText1": "Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust.",
        "levelText2": "Pangea, also spelled Pangaea, in early geologic time, a supercontinent that incorporated almost all the landmasses on Earth.",
        "levelText3": "The theory of plate tectonics explains how the continents have moved apart from one initial continental mass called Pangea.",

        "levelText4": "",

        "levelText5": "There are three kinds of plate tectonic boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform plate boundaries.",
        "levelText6": "Seafloor spreading involves the formation of new ocean rock at a mid-ocean ridge that pushes older ocean rock away towards deep sea trenches.",
        "levelText7": "Folding, faulting, and breaking are geologic processes due to tectonic plate movement that cause physical changes in rocks.",
        "levelText8": "",

        "levelText9": "A mid-ocean ridge is a divergent plate boundary where new ocean crust are formed through volcanic eruptions.",

        "exp_0": "The Earthâ€™s lithosphere, which includes the crust and upper mantle, is made up of a series of pieces, or tectonic plates, that move slowly over time.",
        "exp_1": "The major tectonic plates are the Eurasian, African, Indo-Australian, Pacific, North American, and South American plates.",
        "exp_2": "About 300 million years ago, Earth didn't have seven continents, but instead one massive supercontinent called Pangaea.",

        "exp1_0": "Transform plate boundaries slide relative to one another. Convergent plate boundaries move towards each other. Divergent plate boundaries move away from each other.",
        "exp1_1": "A mid-ocean ridge is a seafloor mountain system formed by plate tectonics. Ocean Trenches are where old ocean crust from one tectonic plate is pushed",
        "exp1_2": "Fold mountains are created where two or more of Earth's tectonic plates are pushed together. A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock.",

        "exp2_0": "As the plates separate, molten rock rises to the seafloor, producing enormous volcanic eruptions of basalt.",
        "exp2_1": "The earths inner and outer core are extremely hot. The mantle is hot, soft and solid rock. The crust contains rock, soil and sediments.",
        "exp2_2": "The earths inner and outer core are extremely hot. The mantle is hot, soft and solid rock. The crust contains rock, soil and sediments.",

        "explain_0": "Plate tectonics is a geological science that studies the movements and nature of the earth's crust.",
        "explain_1": "Subduction occurs at a deep sea trench where two tectonic plates converge, forcing oceanic rock to sink into Earths mantle.",
        "explain_2": "Continental drift describes one of the earliest ways geologists thought continents moved over time.",
        "explain_3": "Earthquakes typically occur at transform and convergent tectonic plate boundaries.",
